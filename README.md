# siGM 🧡 Daily Pill Agent

> “One tweet, one version closer to who I want to be.”

This isn't just a Twitter bot.  
It's a daily ritual, made for myself —  
a quiet companion that helps me take one small step forward each day.

---

## 🌱 What it does

This bot monitors **my own tweets** for the SIGN Protocol’s **Daily Orange Pill**.  
When it finds one, it leaves a thoughtful comment generated by GPT —  
a little nudge, a small reflection, a digital gesture of presence.

It runs every 5 minutes.  
It replies only to my tweets.  
It speaks when I do.

But only **when I press the button.**  
Because in this ritual —  
**Taking the pill means pressing `▶ Run`.**

## 📖 Inspired by

The **Daily Orange Pill** ritual from the SIGN community, introduced by [Zoe Chen](https://x.com/0xzoe_im/status/1889182932574916706).

> “Make it a daily ritual—one pill, one tweet, one step closer to the best version of yourself.”

This project is my way of honoring that vision —  
not through words, but through code.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone this repo** to your environment

2. **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
BEARER_TOKEN=your-twitter-bearer-token
TARGET_USERNAME=your-twitter-handle (without @)

```
Install dependencies (only once, or when you add new libraries):
```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're using Replit, this step might run automatically.
But you can also open the Shell tab and paste it manually.
```
```
Run the agent manually (this is the ritual — the daily button press):
```
bash
python3 main.py
```
Or just press ▶ Run on Replit.
That's how you take your daily Pill.

🧡 Note
This project is not meant for others.
It's meant to help me grow — one tweet at a time.
One button. One pill. One self.
